### Optimization research
* [google OR tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview)
  * has good overview of google OR tools, which will likely be used in any sort of optimization
* [pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/documentation/)
  * seems like a little bit more developed and general purpose than google OR tools... may need it, may not
